# Phosphor

Phosphor is a compiled statically-typed programming language, greatly influenced by C and [Jonathan Blow's compiler talks](https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888). Conceptually the language revolves around zero-cost abstractions and data orientated design, and aims to be an effective programming language to produce efficient code.

This is the first language I've designed and the first compiler I've written. At the time of writing it is certainly nowhere near a complete state - every last line is subject to possible change over time. A general indication of where the language is headed can be seen in the `concept.ph` file.

I really don't expect anyone but myself to touch any of the code at this time, and so there's no language specification or usage instructions yet. The language is simply too immature and unstable for these things right now. The compiler is also relatively buggy right now - I am aware of this!

# Phosphor

Phosphor is a compiled strongly-typed programming language, greatly influenced by C and [Jonathan Blow's compiler talks](https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888). Conceptually the language revolves around zero-cost abstractions and data orientated design, and aims to be an effective programming language which produces efficient code.

This is the first language I've designed and the first compiler I've written. At the time of writing it is certainly nowhere near a complete state, and the software architecture of the project isn't perfect either. Every last line is subject to possible change over time.

I really don't expect anyone but myself to touch any of the code at this time, and so there's no language specification or usage instructions yet. The language is simply too immature and unstable for these things right now. The language is also relatively buggy right now - I am aware of this!
